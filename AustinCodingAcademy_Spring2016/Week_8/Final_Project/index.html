                <p>We don’t know who she is, where she’s come from, or why she’s there. Once inside the store, the woman roams the aisles, clutching a purse that holds her gun. Outside, the man lingers in his van, tortured by the prospect of a missed connection with a woman that caught his eye. Suddenly, the woman grips her gun and starts walking quickly to the front of the store. Just as she does, the man re-enters. As the story unfolds, we realize things aren’t as they appear: the young black woman isn’t there for a robbery attempt, nor did the white man return for an innocent attempt at romance.
